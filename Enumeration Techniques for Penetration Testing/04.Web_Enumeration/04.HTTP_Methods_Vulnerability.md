- This is a vulhub machine called SickOS on running NMAP we will get to knoe that its running http Lighttpd 1.4.x Search for the exploitation on google or follow the sir method, so first we run

      dirsearch -u http://192.168.1.202

- We found an end point test 
- now we try to create a file using curl
- we used differnet methods
- PUT method worked
- We created a file having php reverse shell payload.
- run nc -nlvp 443 and got the shell



### Checking HTTP Methods
Using Nmap

    nmap -v -Pn -sT -sV -p 80 --script http-methods.nse 192.168.56.108

## With URL Path

    nmap -v -Pn -sT -sV -p 80 \
    --script http-methods.nse \
    --script-args http-methods.url-path='/test' \
    192.168.1.202
