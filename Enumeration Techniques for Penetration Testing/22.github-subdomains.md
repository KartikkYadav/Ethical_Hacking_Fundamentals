# github-subdomains

[GitHub Subdomains – Official Repository](https://github.com/gwen001/github-subdomains)

**github-subdomains** is a reconnaissance tool developed by **gwen001** that searches public GitHub repositories for subdomains related to a given target domain. It is particularly useful during asset discovery and security assessments.

---

## Use Cases

- Discover subdomains exposed in public GitHub repositories  
- Identify assets leaked accidentally by developers  
- Enhance reconnaissance and attack surface mapping  

---

## Installation

Install **github-subdomains** using Go:

    go install github.com/gwen001/github-subdomains@latest

Ensure that Go is installed and properly configured in your environment before running this command.

#### Usage

#### Display Help
To view all available options and flags:

    github-subdomains -h

#### Find Subdomains for a Target Domain
To search for subdomains related to example.com using GitHub API tokens:

    github-subdomains -d example.com -t tokens.txt -o output.txt

#### Flag Explanation
- -d example.com
Specifies the target domain.

- -t tokens.txt
File containing GitHub personal access tokens. Using tokens helps avoid rate limiting and improves search coverage.

- -o output.txt
Saves the discovered subdomains to a file.

#### Real-World Example (Tesla)

    github-subdomains -d tesla.com -t github-tokens.txt -o tesla.com-github-subdomains-output.txt

This command searches public GitHub repositories for any subdomains related to tesla.com.

#### Example Output
Running the tool may produce results such as:

    api.tesla.com
    dev.tesla.com
    staging.tesla.com
    internal.tesla.com

These subdomains may have been exposed in configuration files, source code, or documentation hosted on GitHub.

### Importance of Using GitHub Tokens
GitHub enforces strict rate limits on unauthenticated searches. To maximize results and reduce the likelihood of being blocked, use personal access tokens stored in a file (e.g., tokens.txt).

### Recommended Token Scopes

- repo

- read:public_key

- read:org

### Conclusion
github-subdomains is a powerful tool for identifying subdomains leaked in public GitHub repositories. When combined with other enumeration techniques, it significantly improves asset discovery and reconnaissance workflows.


# CTFR

[CTFR – Official GitHub Repository](https://github.com/UnaPibaGeek/ctfr)

**CTFR** is a Python-based reconnaissance tool used to extract subdomains from **Certificate Transparency (CT) logs**. It helps identify both active and historical subdomains associated with a target domain, including assets that may no longer be publicly referenced.

---

## Use Cases

- Discover subdomains issued via SSL/TLS certificates  
- Identify forgotten or deprecated subdomains  
- Enhance asset discovery during reconnaissance and security assessments  

---

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

Navigate to `/opt` (or another preferred directory) and clone the repository:

    cd /opt
    git clone https://github.com/UnaPibaGeek/ctfr.git
    cd ctfr

### Install Dependencies
Install the required Python dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Ensure you are using Python 3

### Usage
### Display Help
To view available options and flags:

    python3 ctfr.py --help

Extract Subdomains for a Target Domain
To extract subdomains for tesla.com:

    python3 ctfr.py -d tesla.com

#### Save Output to a File
To store results in a file for later analysis:

    python3 ctfr.py -d tesla.com -o tesla.com-ctfr.txt

This command saves all discovered subdomains to tesla.com-ctfr.txt.

#### Setting Up a Global Shortcut (Optional)
To run CTFR from anywhere on your system, you can create a global shortcut.

#### Copy the Script to /usr/local/bin

    cp /opt/ctfr/ctfr.py /usr/local/bin/ctfr

Make the Script Executable

    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ctfr

You can now run CTFR globally:

    ctfr -h

#### Example Output
Running the following command:

    python3 ctfr.py -d tesla.com

May return results such as:

    www.tesla.com
    api.tesla.com
    internal.tesla.com
    staging.tesla.com
    mail.tesla.com

These subdomains are discovered from certificates issued for the target domain.

### Conclusion
CTFR is an effective subdomain enumeration tool that leverages Certificate Transparency logs to uncover assets that may not be visible through traditional discovery methods. It is especially useful when combined with DNS brute-forcing and GitHub-based reconnaissance tools.
