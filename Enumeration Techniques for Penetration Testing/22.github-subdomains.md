[GitHub Subdomains – Official Repository](https://github.com/gwen001/github-subdomains)

**github-subdomains** is a reconnaissance tool developed by **gwen001** that searches public GitHub repositories for subdomains related to a given target domain. It is particularly useful during asset discovery and security assessments.

---

## Use Cases

- Discover subdomains exposed in public GitHub repositories  
- Identify assets leaked accidentally by developers  
- Enhance reconnaissance and attack surface mapping  

---

## Installation

Install **github-subdomains** using Go:

    go install github.com/gwen001/github-subdomains@latest

Ensure that Go is installed and properly configured in your environment before running this command.

#### Usage

#### Display Help
To view all available options and flags:

    github-subdomains -h

#### Find Subdomains for a Target Domain
To search for subdomains related to example.com using GitHub API tokens:

    github-subdomains -d example.com -t tokens.txt -o output.txt

#### Flag Explanation
- -d example.com
Specifies the target domain.

- -t tokens.txt
File containing GitHub personal access tokens. Using tokens helps avoid rate limiting and improves search coverage.

- -o output.txt
Saves the discovered subdomains to a file.

#### Real-World Example (Tesla)

    github-subdomains -d tesla.com -t github-tokens.txt -o tesla.com-github-subdomains-output.txt

This command searches public GitHub repositories for any subdomains related to tesla.com.

#### Example Output
Running the tool may produce results such as:

    api.tesla.com
    dev.tesla.com
    staging.tesla.com
    internal.tesla.com

These subdomains may have been exposed in configuration files, source code, or documentation hosted on GitHub.

### Importance of Using GitHub Tokens
GitHub enforces strict rate limits on unauthenticated searches. To maximize results and reduce the likelihood of being blocked, use personal access tokens stored in a file (e.g., tokens.txt).

### Recommended Token Scopes

- repo

- read:public_key

- read:org

### Conclusion
github-subdomains is a powerful tool for identifying subdomains leaked in public GitHub repositories. When combined with other enumeration techniques, it significantly improves asset discovery and reconnaissance workflows.
