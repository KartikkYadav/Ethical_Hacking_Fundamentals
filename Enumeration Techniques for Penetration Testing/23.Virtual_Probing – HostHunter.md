# Virtual Probing – HostHunter

[HostHunter – Official GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/HostHunter)

**HostHunter** is a Python-based reconnaissance tool designed for **Virtual Host (vHOST) discovery and probing**. It helps identify domains hosted on the same IP address, which is especially useful in shared hosting environments.

---

## Use Cases

- Identify virtual hosts associated with a single IP address  
- Discover hidden or undocumented domains on shared infrastructure  
- Expand attack surface during reconnaissance and penetration testing  

---

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

Navigate to `/opt` (or any preferred directory) and clone the repository:


    cd /opt
    git clone https://github.com/SpiderLabs/HostHunter.git
    cd HostHunter

### Install Dependencies
Install the required Python dependencies:

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Ensure Python 3 is installed and available in your environment.

### Notes

- HostHunter is useful when DNS enumeration fails but an IP address is known.
- It works best when combined with tools like CTFR, subfinder, and Amass for comprehensive reconnaissance.

### Conclusion
HostHunter is a valuable virtual host discovery tool that enables security researchers and penetration testers to uncover hidden domains sharing the same IP address. It plays an important role in expanding reconnaissance coverage in shared hosting scenarios.
