# Virtual-Probing

## Virtual Probing – HostHunter

**HostHunter – Official GitHub Repository**

HostHunter is a Python-based reconnaissance tool designed for Virtual Host (VHOST) discovery and probing. It helps identify domains hosted on the same IP address, which is especially useful in shared hosting environments.

### Use Cases
- Identify virtual hosts associated with a single IP address
- Discover hidden or undocumented domains on shared infrastructure
- Expand attack surface during reconnaissance and penetration testing

### Installation

#### Clone the Repository
Navigate to `/opt` (or any preferred directory) and clone the repository:


    cd /opt
    git clone https://github.com/SpiderLabs/HostHunter.git
    cd HostHunter

### Install Dependencies
Install the required Python dependencies:

    
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Ensure Python 3 is installed and available in your environment.

### Usage
Display Help / Options
Run the tool without arguments to view usage instructions:

    python3 hosthunter.py

### Probe an IP Address for Virtual Hosts
To identify virtual hosts associated with a target IP address (example: 8.8.8.8):

    python3 hosthunter.py -t 8.8.8.8

### Flag Explanation
- -t: Specifies the target IP address to probe for virtual hosts.

### Example Output
Running:

    python3 hosthunter.py -t 8.8.8.8

May return results such as:

    vhost1.example.com
    vhost2.example.com
    mail.example.com
    staging.example.com

These domains indicate virtual hosts configured on the same IP address.

### Conclusion
HostHunter is a valuable tool for virtual host enumeration, allowing security researchers to uncover additional domains mapped to a single IP. This technique is especially effective when combined with DNS enumeration, reverse IP lookups, and subdomain discovery tools.
