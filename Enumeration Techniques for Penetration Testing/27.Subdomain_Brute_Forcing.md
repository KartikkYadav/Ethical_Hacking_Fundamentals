# Subdomain Brute Forcing

Subdomain brute forcing is the process of discovering valid subdomains by brute-forcing DNS lookups against a target domain using a large list of potential subdomains.

---

## Types of Subdomain Brute Forcing

### Forward Lookup Brute Force
- Attempts to resolve a list of common subdomains to IP addresses using DNS.

### Reverse Lookup Brute Force
- Attempts to reverse-resolve IP addresses (e.g., from CIDR ranges or infrastructure) back to subdomains.

## Wordlists for Subdomain Enumeration

### Recommended Wordlists
- SecLists by Daniel Miessler
- Assetnote Wordlists
- Jhaddix's All.txt

---

## Local Setup (Kali / Parrot / Ubuntu)


    apt install seclists

    cd /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/

## Useful files

- dns-Jhaddix.txt

- subdomains-top1million-*

## Download Wordlists

### Jhaddix All.txt

    wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jhaddix/.../all.txt -O all.txt

    cat all.txt > /opt/subdomain-wordlists/all-subdomain.txt

### Assetnote Wordlists

    mkdir -p /opt/Wordlists && cd /opt/Wordlists

### Download all from Assetnote (no index files)

    wget -r --no-parent -R "index.html*" -e robots=off https://wordlists-cdn.assetnote.io/data/ -nH

### Organize Your Wordlists

    # Find and copy all subdomain/dns-related wordlists
    mkdir -p /opt/subdomain-wordlists
    
    for file in $(find . -iname "*subdomain*"); do
        cp -v "$file" /opt/subdomain-wordlists/
    done
    
    for file in $(find . -iname "*dns*"); do
        cp -v "$file" /opt/subdomain-wordlists/
    done

### DNS Resolvers

- For tools like massdns, you'll need good resolvers:

      cat /usr/share/seclists/Miscellaneous/dns-resolvers.txt

### Or download the recommended resolver list

- wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blechschmidt/massdns/master/lists/resolvers.txt

## Tools for Subdomain Brute Forcing

    Tool	                Description	Link
    Massdns              	High-performance DNS stub resolver for brute force	GitHub
    Findomain	            Fast subdomain discovery using multiple sources	GitHub
    Amass	                Enumeration, scraping, brute force, and mapping	GitHub
    Sublist3r	            Fast passive subdomain enumeration	GitHub
    Knockpy	                Python-based subdomain brute forcing tool	GitHub

### Summary

- Use high-quality wordlists to increase brute-force effectiveness.

- Combine passive and active tools.

- Always verify results with resolvers to avoid false positives.

- Brute force is still one of the most reliable ways to find hidden subdomains when passive methods fail.
