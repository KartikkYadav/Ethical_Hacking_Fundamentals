# Enumeration

Enumeration is the process of obtaining network resources, usernames, passwords, services, and computer names from a target network. Enumeration is typically the first attack on a target network and involves gathering details such as OS information, user accounts, services, domain information, and network infrastructure. [file:1]

## Key Concepts of Enumeration

- Enumeration involves making actual connections to the target or running commands on the target if physical access is available. [file:1]
- Enumeration can be performed using built-in operating system commands, utilities, or third-party security tools that can run remotely, sometimes even without credentials. [file:1]
- Some information can come from error or informational messages sent back from the remote host. [file:1]
- Multipurpose tools such as **Nmap** and Nessus can enumerate services and provide general information, while specialized tools often provide deeper insights. [file:1]
- Key goals of enumeration include: [file:1]
  - Identifying user, system, and admin accounts  
  - Establishing an active connection with the target on a local network  
  - Directly querying the target for information  
  - Looking for remote IPC$ shares and services that expose data  
  - Creating a null session to gain more access

## Information Gathered During Enumeration

### User and Account Details

- Usernames 
- Groups 
- Default configurations 
- Default passwords 

### Network and Host Details

- Domain names 
- Computer names 
- MAC addresses 
- Network resources 
- Services running 

### System and Service Details

- Auditing services 
- Windows information 
- DNS information 
- SMTP information 
- SNMP information 
- Application details 
- Banners from FTP servers, web servers, and email servers 
- Routing tables

## Approaches to Enumeration

### Local Host Enumeration

- Performed from within the target network. 
- Requires direct or indirect access to the target system.

### Remote Host Enumeration

- Performed from outside the network. 
- Often relies on scanning and network service interrogation.

## Port and Service Enumeration

Common ports and protocols: 

- POP3/POP3S – 110/tcp, 995/tcp  
- IMAP/IMAPS – 143/tcp, 993/tcp  
- SNMP – 161/udp  
- MSSQL – 1433/tcp  
- RPC – 111/udp, 135/tcp  
- SIP – 5060/udp  
- AJP – 8009/tcp

## Example Commands for Enumeration

### Enumerating Network Resources

    Use `net view` to list available network resources: 
    
    net view \<target-ip>



### Enumerating Users and Groups

    Use `net user` to list local user accounts: 
    
    net user


    Use `net group` to list groups: 
    
    net group


### Finding Open Ports with Nmap

    Use Nmap to scan for open ports and services: 
    
    nmap -sV -O <target-ip>


### Enumerating SMB Shares

    Use `smbclient` to list SMB shares: 
    
    smbclient -L //<target-ip> -U ""


### Gathering SNMP Information

    Use `snmpwalk` to gather SNMP data: 
    
    snmpwalk -v 2c -c public <target-ip>


### Extracting Routing Tables

    Use `route print` to display routing tables:
    
    route print


### Checking DNS Information

    Use `nslookup` to gather DNS details: 
    
    nslookup <domain>


### Banner Grabbing with Netcat

    Use `nc` to grab banners from a target service:
    
    nc <target-ip> 80
