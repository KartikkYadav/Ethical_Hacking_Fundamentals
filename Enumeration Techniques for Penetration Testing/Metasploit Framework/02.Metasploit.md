# Metasploit

Metasploit is a powerful computer security project and framework widely used for penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and exploit development [attached_image:1]. It is an open-source tool owned by Rapid7 that provides a vast collection of exploits, payloads, and auxiliary modules which allow security professionals to test and probe the security weaknesses of computer systems and networks [attached_image:1]. Metasploit helps simulate attacks to identify vulnerabilities, test defenses, and improve security measures by safely demonstrating the potential risks attackers could exploit [attached_image:1].
