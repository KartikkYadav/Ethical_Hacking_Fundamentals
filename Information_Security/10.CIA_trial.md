# üõ° Security Concepts: CIA Triad & CVSS

---

## CIA Triad

The **CIA triad** is a fundamental model in information security, representing the three core principles that guide policies, procedures, and controls.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Confidentiality
- **Definition:** Ensures that data is only accessible to those who have proper authorization.  
- **Goal:** Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.  
- **How it‚Äôs enforced:**
  - Access control lists (ACLs) and permissions
  - Encryption (data at rest & in transit)
  - User authentication (passwords, MFA)
- **Examples:**
  - Encrypting customer credit card data
  - Restricting access to payroll data to only HR staff

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Integrity
- **Definition:** Maintains the accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of data over its entire lifecycle.  
- **Goal:** Prevent unauthorized modifications or accidental corruption.  
- **How it‚Äôs enforced:**
  - Checksums & hashes (to detect tampering)
  - Version control & audit trails
  - Database integrity constraints
- **Examples:**
  - Using SHA-256 to verify file downloads
  - Logging changes to patient records in a hospital system

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Availability
- **Definition:** Ensures that data and systems are accessible to authorized users whenever needed.  
- **Goal:** Prevent disruptions that could block access to important resources.  
- **How it‚Äôs enforced:**
  - Redundant systems and failover strategies
  - Regular backups & disaster recovery plans
  - Protection against DoS/DDoS attacks
- **Examples:**
  - Keeping multiple servers in different locations
  - Using UPS systems to handle power outages

## üìù Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

### What is CVSS?
- CVSS is a **standardized framework** developed by **FIRST.org** to rate the severity of security vulnerabilities.
- It assigns a **numerical score** (0.0 to 10.0), translating into qualitative ratings:
  - None, Low, Medium, High, Critical.
- Widely used by security teams, vendors, and risk managers.

### Key Components of CVSS

1. **Base Metrics**
   - Describe intrinsic properties of a vulnerability that remain constant.
   - Examples:
     - Attack Vector (AV): Local, Adjacent, Network, Physical
     - Attack Complexity (AC): Low, High
     - Privileges Required (PR): None, Low, High
     - User Interaction (UI): None, Required
     - Impacts on Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability

2. **Temporal Metrics**
   - Factors that change over time.
   - Examples:
     - Exploit Code Maturity
     - Remediation Level

3. **Environmental Metrics**
   - Adjust scores based on specific organizational context or asset importance.

### Example CVSS Score

| Metric                   | Value   |
|---------------------------|---------|
| Attack Vector             | Network |
| Attack Complexity         | Low     |
| Privileges Required       | None    |
| User Interaction          | None    |
| Confidentiality Impact    | High    |
| Integrity Impact          | High    |
| Availability Impact       | High    |
| **Base Score**            | **9.8 (Critical)** |

This could describe a typical **remote code execution vulnerability** in a web server.

## ‚úÖ Summary
- The **CIA triad** ensures information security by balancing **confidentiality, integrity, and availability**.
- The **CVSS** provides a structured, industry-standard way to assess and communicate how severe a vulnerability is, helping prioritize fixes.
