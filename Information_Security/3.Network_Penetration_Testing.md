# 🧪 Types of Penetration Testing

## 🔍 What is Penetration Testing?

**Penetration Testing (Pen Testing)** is a simulated cyberattack on a system, network, or application to identify security vulnerabilities before real attackers do.

## 📂 Types of Penetration Testing

### 1. 🔓 **Black Box Testing**
- **Tester Knowledge**: No internal knowledge of the system.
- **Approach**: Mimics an external attacker.
- **Pros**: Realistic simulation of an outsider attack.
- **Cons**: Time-consuming, may miss internal flaws.

### 2. 🧠 **White Box Testing**
- **Tester Knowledge**: Full knowledge of source code, architecture, and systems.
- **Approach**: Internal audit with access to internal data.
- **Pros**: Comprehensive and deep vulnerability coverage.
- **Cons**: Less realistic from an attack perspective.

### 3. ⚫⚪ **Gray Box Testing**
- **Tester Knowledge**: Partial knowledge (e.g., user credentials, architecture overview).
- **Approach**: Simulates an insider threat or a compromised user.
- **Pros**: Balanced approach, faster than black box.
- **Cons**: May not uncover all external threats.

## 🖥️ Based on Target Environment

### 4. 🌐 **Web Application Penetration Testing**
- Focus: Web apps and APIs.
- Tests for: XSS, SQLi, CSRF, insecure session management.

### 5. 🖧 **Network Penetration Testing**
- Focus: Internal or external networks.
- Tests for: Open ports, misconfigurations, weak protocols.

### 6. 💾 **Wireless Penetration Testing**
- Focus: Wi-Fi and wireless protocols.
- Tests for: Weak encryption (WEP/WPA), rogue access points.

### 7. 📱 **Mobile Penetration Testing**
- Focus: iOS/Android apps.
- Tests for: Data leakage, insecure storage, poor encryption.

### 8. 🖨️ **Social Engineering Penetration Testing**
- Focus: Human layer.
- Techniques: Phishing, baiting, pretexting.
- Goal: Test employee awareness and response.

### 9. 🏢 **Physical Penetration Testing**
- Focus: Physical access to infrastructure.
- Tests for: Entry security, USB drops, locked cabinets, surveillance evasion.

## ✅ Best Practices

- Define scope and permissions.
- Use both automated tools and manual techniques.
- Always report findings with remediation steps.
- Ensure post-test cleanup (e.g., malware/scripts).
- Get written consent before performing any test.
