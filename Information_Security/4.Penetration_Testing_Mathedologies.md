## 🧨 Hacking Phases (Ethical Hacking Process)

Ethical hackers follow a structured approach to simulate real-world cyberattacks. This process typically includes **five main phases**:

### 1. 🔍 **Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)**
- Goal: Collect as much data as possible about the target.
- Types:
  - **Passive**: Without interacting with the target (e.g., WHOIS, Google dorking).
  - **Active**: Direct interaction (e.g., ping sweeps, port scans).
- Tools: Nmap, Maltego, Recon-ng

---

### 2. 🧭 **Scanning**
- Goal: Identify open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.
- Techniques:
  - Network Scanning
  - Vulnerability Scanning
  - Enumeration
- Tools: Nmap, Nessus, OpenVAS

---

### 3. 🛠️ **Gaining Access**
- Goal: Exploit vulnerabilities to gain control.
- Methods:
  - Exploiting web vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS)
  - Password attacks (Brute force)
  - Buffer overflow
- Tools: Metasploit, Hydra, SQLmap

---

### 4. 🔐 **Maintaining Access**
- Goal: Stay inside the system for future access.
- Methods:
  - Installing backdoors
  - Creating new user accounts
  - Using trojans
- Tools: Netcat, Meterpreter

---

### 5. 🧹 **Covering Tracks**
- Goal: Erase evidence of hacking activity.
- Techniques:
  - Clear logs
  - Modify timestamps
  - Use rootkits

## 🧪 Penetration Testing Methodologies

### ⚪ White Box Testing

- **Definition**: Tester has full knowledge of the system (source code, architecture).
- **Goal**: Comprehensive testing with full internal access.
- **Simulates**: Insider with full access (e.g., developer or admin).
- **Pros**: Deep and thorough analysis.
- **Cons**: Not realistic for external attacks.

---

### ⚫ Black Box Testing

- **Definition**: Tester has no prior knowledge of the system.
- **Goal**: Simulate an external attacker trying to break in.
- **Simulates**: A real-world hacker with zero access.
- **Pros**: Realistic and unbiased.
- **Cons**: May miss internal flaws, slower.

---

### ⚪⚫ Gray Box Testing

- **Definition**: Tester has partial knowledge (e.g., credentials, internal documentation).
- **Goal**: Simulate a user or insider with limited access.
- **Simulates**: Insider threat or compromised user.
- **Pros**: Balanced and efficient.
- **Cons**: Assumes attacker has some knowledge.

## 🧾 Comparison Table

| Methodology | Tester Knowledge       | Realism      | Depth of Test | Simulates                 |
|-------------|------------------------|--------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| White Box   | Full                   | Low          | High          | Insider with full access  |
| Black Box   | None                   | High         | Low to Medium | External attacker         |
| Gray Box    | Partial                | Medium-High  | Medium-High   | Insider or user-level attacker |

## ✅ Best Practices for Pen Testing

- Always get **written authorization** before testing.
- Clearly define the **scope** and **rules of engagement**.
- Use a combination of manual and automated tools.
- Provide a detailed **report** with findings and recommendations.
