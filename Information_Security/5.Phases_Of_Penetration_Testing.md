# 🛡️ 7 Phases of Penetration Testing

Penetration testing simulates cyberattacks to identify vulnerabilities. The process typically follows these 7 phases:

---

## 1. 🔍 **Planning and Preparation**
- Define scope, objectives, rules of engagement.
- Obtain necessary permissions and legal authorization.
- Identify testing boundaries and restrictions.

---

## 2. 🗂️ **Reconnaissance (Information Gathering)**
- Collect information about the target system or network.
- Passive reconnaissance: Gather data without direct interaction (e.g., WHOIS, DNS lookup).
- Active reconnaissance: Directly engage target (e.g., ping, port scanning).

---

## 3. 🧭 **Scanning and Enumeration**
- Identify open ports, services, and potential entry points.
- Use automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities.
- Enumerate details such as usernames, shares, and network resources.

---

## 4. 🛠️ **Gaining Access (Exploitation)**
- Use discovered vulnerabilities to gain access.
- Methods include exploiting software flaws, password attacks, and social engineering.
- Tools: Metasploit, SQLmap, Hydra.

---

## 5. 🔐 **Maintaining Access**
- Establish persistence to stay within the system.
- Install backdoors or create user accounts.
- Ensure the ability to return later if needed.

---

## 6. 🧹 **Clearing Tracks**
- Remove evidence of testing activities.
- Clear logs and hide tools or files.
- Prevent detection by system administrators.

---

## 7. 📋 **Reporting**
- Document all findings in detail.
- Provide risk assessment and remediation recommendations.
- Deliver a clear, actionable report to stakeholders.

**Note:** Always conduct penetration testing ethically and with explicit permission.
