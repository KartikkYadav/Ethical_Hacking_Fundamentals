# üéØ Penetration Testing Scope (Detailed Notes)

---

## What is Penetration Testing Scope?

The **scope** of a penetration test defines the boundaries, targets, and limitations of the testing engagement. It ensures that testing is **focused, authorized, and safe**, preventing unintended disruptions or legal issues.

---

## Why is Defining Scope Important?

- **Legal Authorization:** Ensures testers have permission for all activities.
- **Risk Management:** Protects critical or sensitive systems from accidental damage.
- **Resource Optimization:** Focuses efforts on relevant assets.
- **Clear Expectations:** Aligns tester and client on objectives and limitations.

---

## Key Components of Penetration Testing Scope

### 1. **Target Systems**

- Specifies which systems, applications, networks, or devices will be tested.
- Can include:
  - IP address ranges (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)
  - Domains and subdomains (e.g., example.com, api.example.com)
  - Specific applications (e.g., company web app, mobile app)
  - Network segments or physical locations

### 2. **Types of Tests**

- Defines the kind of penetration testing to be performed:
  - **External Testing:** Targets internet-facing assets.
  - **Internal Testing:** Focuses on inside the corporate network.
  - **Web Application Testing:** Examines web apps for vulnerabilities.
  - **Wireless Network Testing:** Checks Wi-Fi security.
  - **Social Engineering:** Tests human vulnerabilities via phishing, pretexting.

### 3. **In-Scope vs Out-of-Scope**

- Clearly list which systems or areas are **in scope** and **out of scope**.
- Helps avoid accidental testing of sensitive or unrelated systems.
- Example:
  - **In-Scope:** Public website, corporate VPN gateway.
  - **Out-of-Scope:** HR payroll database, third-party vendor systems.

### 4. **Testing Timeframe and Windows**

- Specifies when testing can occur (e.g., business hours, after-hours, weekends).
- Important to minimize impact on operations.
- Example: Testing allowed between 8 PM - 6 AM only.

### 5. **Authorization and Compliance**

- Names of authorized personnel and stakeholders.
- Legal agreements or contracts covering the test.
- Compliance requirements (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA).

### 6. **Rules of Engagement**

- Restrictions on types of attacks allowed (e.g., no Denial of Service attacks).
- Communication protocols during testing.
- Incident handling procedures if critical vulnerabilities are found.
