## 1. What is a Bug Bounty?

A **Bug Bounty** program is an initiative by organizations where security researchers (ethical hackers) are rewarded for finding and responsibly disclosing security vulnerabilities in their systems, websites, or applications.

---

## 2. Purpose of Bug Bounty Programs

- Encourage external security research.
- Identify vulnerabilities before malicious hackers exploit them.
- Improve overall security posture.
- Cost-effective compared to hiring full-time security teams.

|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Vulnerability         | A weakness that can be exploited to compromise a system. |
| Exploit               | A technique or code used to take advantage of a vulnerability. |
| Responsible Disclosure| Reporting vulnerabilities to the organization privately and giving time to fix. |
| Reward/Payout         | Monetary or non-monetary compensation for valid findings. |
| Scope                 | Defined systems or areas that are eligible for testing. |
| Out of Scope          | Systems or vulnerabilities that should not be tested or reported. |

## 4. Bug Bounty Process

### Step 1: Understand the Scope
- Carefully read the program's scope.
- Identify in-scope targets (domains, apps, APIs).
- Note out-of-scope areas to avoid legal issues.

### Step 2: Reconnaissance
- Gather information about the target.
- Use passive and active info-gathering techniques.

### Step 3: Vulnerability Discovery
- Use manual testing and automated tools.
- Common vulnerabilities to look for:
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - SQL Injection (SQLi)
  - Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  - Authentication bypass
  - Sensitive data exposure

### Step 4: Exploitation & Verification
- Confirm the vulnerability is exploitable.
- Avoid causing damage or disruption.

### Step 5: Reporting
- Write a clear, concise, and reproducible report.
- Include:
  - Description of the issue
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Impact assessment
  - Proof of concept (PoC)
  - Suggested remediation

### Step 6: Follow-up
- Respond promptly to program managers‚Äô questions.
- Verify the fix once applied.
