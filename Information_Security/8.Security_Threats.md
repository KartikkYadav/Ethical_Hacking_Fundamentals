# üõ°Ô∏è Red Team, Blue Team, Purple Team & Security Threats Notes

---

## 1. Red Team

- **Role:** Offensive security team.
- **Purpose:** Simulate real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Activities:**
  - Conduct penetration testing.
  - Social engineering attacks.
  - Exploit weaknesses to test defenses.
  - Emulate advanced persistent threats (APTs).
- **Goal:** Improve organization's security posture by exposing weaknesses.

---

## 2. Blue Team

- **Role:** Defensive security team.
- **Purpose:** Protect and defend the organization‚Äôs IT environment.
- **Activities:**
  - Monitor networks and systems.
  - Incident detection and response.
  - Implement security controls and policies.
  - Perform vulnerability management.
  - Conduct security awareness training.
- **Goal:** Detect, prevent, and respond to cyber threats effectively.

## 3. Purple Team

- **Role:** Collaboration team combining Red and Blue Team efforts.
- **Purpose:** Enhance communication and improve security by integrating offensive and defensive tactics.
- **Activities:**
  - Facilitate knowledge sharing.
  - Validate Blue Team‚Äôs detection and response capabilities.
  - Tune security tools based on Red Team findings.
  - Develop attack simulations with real-time defense adjustments.
- **Goal:** Create a continuous feedback loop to strengthen overall security.

## 4. Security Threats (Detailed Explanation)

### Malware
- Malicious software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems.
- Types include:
  - **Virus:** Attaches to files and spreads when executed.
  - **Worm:** Self-replicates and spreads without user action.
  - **Ransomware:** Encrypts files and demands payment for decryption.
  - **Spyware:** Secretly gathers user information.
  - **Trojan Horse:** Disguised as legitimate software but performs malicious actions.

### Phishing
- A social engineering attack using deceptive emails, messages, or websites to trick users into revealing sensitive information (passwords, credit card details).
- Often involves spoofed domains or urgent calls to action.

### Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
- Attackers intercept communication between two parties without their knowledge.
- Can capture, alter, or inject data.
- Common in unsecured Wi-Fi networks or weak encryption protocols.

### Denial of Service (DoS) / Distributed DoS (DDoS)
- Attack aimed at overwhelming a system or network with traffic, causing it to become unavailable.
- DDoS involves multiple systems coordinating the attack, making it harder to mitigate.

### SQL Injection
- An attack that inserts malicious SQL queries into input fields to manipulate backend databases.
- Can result in data theft, data loss, or unauthorized access.

### Zero-Day Exploit
- Exploiting vulnerabilities unknown to the vendor or security community.
- Highly dangerous due to lack of patches or defenses.

### Insider Threat
- Threats from employees, contractors, or business partners with legitimate access.
- Can be malicious (data theft) or accidental (negligent behavior).

### Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)
- Long-term, targeted cyberattack by skilled adversaries (often nation-states or organized groups).
- Aim to steal sensitive data or disrupt critical infrastructure over extended periods.

---

### Threat Vectors
- **Network Attacks:** Targeting network infrastructure, intercepting data, or disrupting communications.
- **Social Engineering:** Manipulating people to divulge confidential info or perform actions.
- **Physical Access:** Unauthorized entry to premises or hardware.
- **Software Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting bugs or design flaws in applications or systems.
- **Supply Chain Attacks:** Compromising third-party services or software to infiltrate target.
