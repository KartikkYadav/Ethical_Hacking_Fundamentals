# üîê Classification of Security Threats

---

Security threats can be classified based on various criteria such as origin, nature, intent, and impact. Understanding these classifications helps in developing effective security strategies.

---

## 1. Based on Origin

### a. Internal Threats
- Originate from within the organization.
- Examples:
  - Disgruntled employees.
  - Accidental data leaks by staff.
  - Insider misuse of access privileges.
- Characteristics:
  - Often harder to detect.
  - Have legitimate access to systems.

### b. External Threats
- Originate outside the organization.
- Examples:
  - Hackers.
  - Cybercriminals.
  - Nation-state actors.
- Characteristics:
  - Use various attack vectors (phishing, malware, DDoS).
  - Target organizational assets from outside.

---

## 2. Based on Nature of Threat

### a. Passive Threats
- Do not alter system resources or data.
- Aim to obtain information without detection.
- Example:
  - Eavesdropping on network traffic.
  - Traffic analysis.

### b. Active Threats
- Attempt to alter system resources or affect operations.
- Examples:
  - Data modification.
  - Denial of service attacks.
  - Malware infections.

---

## 3. Based on Intent

### a. Intentional Threats
- Deliberate actions to cause harm.
- Examples:
  - Hacking.
  - Data theft.
  - Sabotage.

### b. Unintentional Threats
- Caused by human error or system failure.
- Examples:
  - Misconfiguration.
  - Accidental deletion of data.
  - Software bugs.

---

## 4. Based on Impact

### a. Confidentiality Threats
- Threats that lead to unauthorized disclosure of information.
- Examples:
  - Data breaches.
  - Phishing attacks.

### b. Integrity Threats
- Threats that compromise data accuracy or reliability.
- Examples:
  - Data tampering.
  - SQL Injection.

### c. Availability Threats
- Threats that disrupt access to systems or data.
- Examples:
  - Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
  - Hardware failures.

---

## 5. Based on Attack Vectors

### a. Network-Based Threats
- Exploit vulnerabilities in network protocols or devices.
- Examples:
  - Man-in-the-Middle (MITM).
  - Packet sniffing.
  - DDoS.

### b. Host-Based Threats
- Target individual devices or endpoints.
- Examples:
  - Malware.
  - Unauthorized access.
  - Privilege escalation.

### c. Application-Based Threats
- Target software vulnerabilities.
- Examples:
  - SQL Injection.
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
  - Buffer overflow.

### d. Physical Threats
- Threats to physical hardware or facilities.
- Examples:
  - Theft.
  - Vandalism.
  - Natural disasters.

---

## 6. Based on Attacker Type

### a. Script Kiddies
- Inexperienced hackers using pre-written tools.
- Generally low sophistication.

### b. Hacktivists
- Attackers motivated by political or social causes.

### c. Cybercriminals
- Organized groups motivated by financial gain.

### d. Nation-State Actors
- Highly skilled groups sponsored by governments targeting critical infrastructure or espionage.

### e. Insider Threats
- Employees or contractors misusing access intentionally or accidentally.
