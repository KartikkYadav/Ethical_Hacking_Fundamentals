### 🔑 CIA Triad

- **Confidentiality**: Prevent unauthorized access to data.
- **Integrity**: Ensure data accuracy and completeness.
- **Availability**: Ensure reliable access to information.

---

### 🔐 Types of Security

- **Physical Security**: Protects hardware and facilities.
- **Network Security**: Protects data in transit.
- **Application Security**: Secures software and apps.
- **Operational Security**: Policies and procedures for handling data securely.
- **End-user Security**: User awareness and behavior (e.g., phishing defense).

---

### ⚠️ Common Threats

- **Malware**: Includes viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware.
- **Phishing**: Fraudulent emails to steal credentials.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack**: Interception of communication.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Overload system to cause failure.
- **SQL Injection**: Malicious SQL code into database queries.

---

### 🔧 Security Mechanisms

- **Authentication**: Verifying identity (passwords, biometrics).
- **Authorization**: Granting access rights.
- **Encryption**: Securing data by encoding it.
- **Firewalls**: Filters incoming/outgoing traffic.
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** / **Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)**

---

### 🔒 Cryptography Basics

- **Symmetric Encryption**: Same key for encryption/decryption (e.g., AES).
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Public and private keys (e.g., RSA).
- **Hash Functions**: Irreversible, used for data integrity (e.g., SHA-256).
- **Digital Signatures**: Ensures authenticity and integrity.

---

### 📜 Security Policies & Best Practices

- **Least Privilege**: Users get minimum access required.
- **Need to Know**: Access based on job function.
- **Regular Updates**: Patch software vulnerabilities.
- **User Training**: Reduce human error.
- **Backups**: Protect against data loss.

---

### 🔐 Access Control Models

- **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**: Owner controls access.
- **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**: System-enforced policies.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Access by role.
- **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Based on user attributes.

---

### 🚨 Incident Response

**Steps**:
1. Identification  
2. Containment  
3. Eradication  
4. Recovery  
5. Lessons Learned  

---

### 📚 Security Standards & Frameworks

- **ISO/IEC 27001**: Information Security Management System (ISMS)
- **NIST**: Cybersecurity Framework
- **PCI-DSS**: For handling credit card information
- **GDPR**: EU data protection regulation

---

### 📈 Emerging Trends in Information Security

- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify.
- **Cloud Security**: Protecting cloud infrastructure and data.
- **AI in Security**: Threat detection and prevention.
- **Blockchain for Security**: Data integrity and decentralization.
