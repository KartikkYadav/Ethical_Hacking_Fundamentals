## 📥 Download the CUDA keyring package

Visit the official CUDA download site for additional details:

- 🔗 https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads

Download the CUDA keyring .deb package:

    wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/debian12/x86_64/cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb

## 🔐 Install the keyring package
This allows apt to trust the NVIDIA repository.

    apt install ./cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb

## 📝 Comment the kali linux repo /etc/apt/sources.list
Ensure the new NVIDIA repository was added correctly. If needed, manually verify and comment the Kali Linux repo:

    vim /etc/apt/sources.list

    # See https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/kali-linux-sources-list-repositories/
    # deb https://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main contrib non-free non-free-firmware
    # Additional line for source packages
    # deb-src https://http.kali.org/kali kali-rolling main contrib non-free non-free-firmware

## 🔄 Update package index

    apt update

## 🎮 Install the NVIDIA GPU driver
This installs the latest driver compatible with your GPU.

    apt install nvidia-driver

## 🔁 Reboot to load the driver

    reboot

## 🧰 Install the CUDA Toolkit

This installs version 12.6 of the CUDA development environment.

List loaded kernel modules related to NVIDIA:

    lsmod | grep -i nvidia

If everything appears correct, reboot one more time (optional, for good measure):

    reboot
