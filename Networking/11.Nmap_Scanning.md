# Nmap-Scanning-Workflow

## Nmap Scanning Workflow: Step-by-Step Overview

Performing an effective Nmap scan involves a structured sequence of steps designed to gather detailed information about a target host or network. Here is a comprehensive workflow outlining the typical phases of an Nmap scan:

---

### 1. Ping the Host (Host Discovery)

Before scanning ports and services, verify that the target host is reachable and alive. This step avoids wasting resources on non-responsive targets.

**Host Discovery Methods:**
- **ARPing:** On local networks, sends ARP requests to detect active devices.
- **ICMP Ping:** Uses ICMP Echo Request packets to confirm host availability.
- **TCP Ping:** Sends TCP packets to common ports like 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS) to detect hosts that block ICMP.
- **UDP Ping:** Sends UDP packets to elicit responses, useful to bypass certain firewalls.

### 2. Check the PTR Record of the IP Address

A **PTR (Pointer)** record performs a reverse DNS lookup, resolving an IP address back to a domain name. This can reveal the host’s identity and assist with further reconnaissance or correlation.

---

### 3. Port Scanning of Host (Default Top 1000 Ports)

Identify which ports are open on the target system to discover running services. Nmap’s default scan checks the most common 1000 TCP ports, providing a broad view of network exposure.

### 4. Service and Version Detection

Probe the open ports to determine the exact services running and their versions. This helps in assessing vulnerabilities and network inventory management.

Example command:
          
    nmap -sV target.com

### 5. OS Detection

Determine the operating system of the target host by analyzing network stack behavior, fingerprinting response patterns to identify OS types and versions. This provides insights into possible attack vectors.

Example command:

    nmap -O target.com

### 6. Save the Output of Nmap

After the scan completes, it is crucial to save results for analysis, auditing, or future reference. Nmap supports multiple output formats such as normal text, XML, and grepable.

Common save commands:
- **Normal output:** `nmap -oN output.txt target.com`
- **XML output:** `nmap -oX output.xml target.com`
- **Grepable output:** `nmap -oG output.gnmap target.com`

This structured approach ensures thorough reconnaissance, from verifying host availability to detailed service and OS enumeration, with the added step of preserving scan results for continued security evaluation or documentation.
