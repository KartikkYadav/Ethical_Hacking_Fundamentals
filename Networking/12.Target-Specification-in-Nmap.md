## Target Specification in Nmap

Nmap provides versatile options for specifying target hosts or networks to scan, allowing you to define single hosts, multiple hosts, ranges, subnets, and use input files to automate scans. Below is an organized overview with examples showing how to specify targets effectively:

---

### Single and Multiple Hosts

- Scan one or multiple hosts/domains by listing them separated by spaces:

      nmap armourinfosec.com thehackersworld.com

      nmap 192.168.1.35 192.168.1.1

      nmap -v 192.168.1.31 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.247


---

### Using IP Ranges and Subnets

- Scan all hosts in a subnet by using CIDR notation:

      nmap 192.168.1.0/24

      nmap 192.168.56.1/24


- Scan IP ranges with hyphen-separated numbers:

      nmap 192.168.1.1-254

      nmap 192.168.1.1-51,200-254

      nmap -v 192.168.1.1-51,250-254

      nmap 192.168.1.2,1-100

      nmap 192.168.1.3/24

      nmap 192.168.1.2.1/24

text

- Scan multiple specific IPs separated by commas:

      nmap 192.168.1.1,11,27,100,207

      nmap 192.168.1.1,10,50,60,100,200,244,231,31,61


- Scan a restricted range within subnet:

      nmap 192.168.1.200-254


---

### Using Input File for Target List

- Create a text file (e.g., ip.txt) containing target IPs or hostnames:

- contents of ip.txt
      
      192.168.1.1
      192.168.1.10
      192.168.1.31
      192.168.1.61
      192.168.1.102
      192.168.1.103
      192.168.1.104


- Scan the list of targets using the -iL option:

      nmap -v -iL ip.txt


---

### Random Hosts Scanning

- Scan a specified number of random IP addresses on the Internet:

      nmap -v -iR 10

text

---

### Excluding Hosts from Scans

- Exclude specific IPs or ranges from a subnet scan using --exclude:

      nmap -v 192.168.1.1/24 --exclude 192.168.1.1-10
      
      nmap -v 192.168.1.1/24 --exclude 192.168.1.1-25
      
      nmap -v 192.168.1.1/24 --excludefile ip.txt
      
      nmap -v 192.168.1.1/24 --exclude 192.168.1.52-100,250


---

### Utility for Generating IP Lists

- Install prips to generate IP ranges easily:

      apt install prips


- Use prips to list all IPs in a subnet or range:

      prips 192.168.1.0/24

      prips 192.168.1.0/28

      prips 192.168.1.0/26 | grep 192.168.1.231

## Summary

Nmap's target specification capabilities offer a wide range of flexible options from scanning individual IPs, multiple hosts, entire subnets, to using input files and excluding hosts dynamically. This flexibility allows for efficient and precise scanning tailored to varying network sizes and conditions.

Use these target specifications in your scan commands to define exactly which hosts or networks you want to analyze.

If you need help crafting specific Nmap commands based on these target options, feel free to ask!
