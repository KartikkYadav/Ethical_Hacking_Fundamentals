# Reconnaissance (Footprinting)

## What is Reconnaissance?

Reconnaissance is the initial phase of a penetration test or cyberattack, where the attacker gathers as much information as possible about the target system or organization.  
This phase is crucial as it helps to plan the subsequent stages of an attack or penetration test.

---

## Types of Reconnaissance

### 1. Passive Reconnaissance
- Collecting information **without directly interacting** with the target.
- Examples:
  - Searching public records
  - Examining social media
  - Looking up DNS or WHOIS information

### 2. Active Reconnaissance
- Involves **direct interaction** with the target system to gather information.
- Examples:
  - Port scanning
  - Network mapping

---

## Footprinting Techniques

### 1. WHOIS Lookup
- Used to gather information about domain ownership, registration, and contact details.

### 2. DNS Enumeration
- Identifies DNS records such as:
  - A records (address records)
  - MX records (mail exchange)
  - NS records (name servers)
- Helps to map the domain and its associated services.

### 3. Google Hacking
- Using advanced Google search operators to find sensitive information unintentionally exposed online.

## Tools Used for Footprinting

- **Nslookup**: Query DNS to obtain domain name or IP address mapping.
- **Nmap**: For network discovery and security auditing.
- **theHarvester**: For gathering emails, subdomains, hosts, employee names from different public sources (search engines, PGP key servers, etc.).
- **Maltego**: Provides a graphical representation of relationships and real-world links between people, groups, websites, domains, etc.

## Objectives of Footprinting

- To gather as much information as possible about the target such as:
  - Domain names
  - IP addresses
  - Email addresses
  - Phone numbers
  - Organizational structure
- Helps attackers (or penetration testers) to identify potential entry points into the system.

## Organization Information

- **Organization Website**: Public-facing resource with general/technical information  
- **Company Directory**: Lists employees, roles, and contact details  
- **Employee Details**: Profiles from LinkedIn, social media, or public platforms  
- **Location Details**: Physical addresses and office locations  
- **Addresses/Phone Numbers**: Valuable for pretexting or phone-based phishing  
- **Comments in HTML Source Code**: Developer notes or references  
  - Example: `<!-- TODO: Remove this link before going live -->`  
- **Security Policies Deployed**: Public policies or notices showing security posture  
- **Web Server Links**: External APIs or third-party services linked to the website  
- **Background of Organization**: Company’s history and structure  
- **News/Press Releases**: Recent changes, expansions, or acquisitions  

---

## Network Information

- **Domain Names**: Identifies organization’s internet presence  
  - Example: `example.com`, `sub.example.com`  
- **Internal Domains**: Insights into internal naming conventions  
  - Example: `internal.local`, `intranet.example.com`  
- **IP Addresses**: Public and private IP ranges  
- **Unmonitored/Private Websites**: Internal applications not publicly indexed  
- **TCP/UDP Services**: Services running on specific ports  
  - Example: HTTP (port 80), SSH (port 22)  
- **VPN/IDS/IPS/Access Controls**: Secure access and network protection mechanisms  
- **VPN Information**: Configuration details or vulnerabilities in VPN solutions  
- **Phone Numbers/VoIP**: Communication systems for potential social engineering  

---

## Operating System Information

- **User & Group Names/Info**: Usernames and group memberships  
- **Banner Grabbing**: Captures banners to identify software/versions  
- **Routing Tables**: Network routes and interfaces  
- **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)**: Device and network details  
- **System Architecture**: 32-bit, 64-bit, or other platform details  
- **Remote Systems**: Connected or shared systems  
- **System Names**: Naming conventions indicating roles  
  - Example: `DC01` (Domain Controller), `SQLServer`  
- **Passwords**: Credentials from exposed services, brute force, or social engineering  

---

## External Reconnaissance

- **Network**: Public-facing IPs and domains  
- **Phone**: Public or leaked phone numbers  
- **Website**: Analyze forms, scripts, and structure  
- **Source Code**: Public repositories (e.g., GitHub) containing sensitive information  
- **Website Mirroring**: Create offline copies using tools like `wget` or `HTTrack`  
- **Archive Sites**: Historical snapshots (e.g., Archive.org, CachedView)  
- **GitHub Recon**: Tools like Gitrob, truffleHog to search repositories and commits  
- **Whois**: Domain registration details and admin contacts  
- **Web Server Content**: Backup files, configuration files, or sensitive data  
- **Email Header**: Metadata showing IPs, server paths, and infrastructure  
- **Google/Search Engines**: Google Dorking for sensitive data or internal links  
- **Google Hacking**: Advanced queries (`filetype:`, `site:`, `inurl:`)  

---

## Internal Reconnaissance

- **IP Addresses**: Internal network mapping and critical systems  
- **Internal DNS**: Internal domain records and zone transfers  
- **Private Websites**: Intranet and other internal web apps  
- **Dumpster Diving**: Searching for sensitive information in discarded items  
- **Shoulder Surfing**: Observing user activity for credentials or data

## Attack Surface Mapping

> Attack surface mapping is the process of identifying and analyzing all possible points of interaction with a target system or organization. This helps security professionals understand the scope of potential vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit.

### Key Components of Attack Surface Mapping

#### 1. External Attack Surface
Focuses on everything exposed to the public internet:

- **Public-Facing Applications**: Web apps, APIs, email servers, VPN gateways  
- **Public IP Addresses**: IP ranges associated with the organization  
- **DNS Records**: Subdomains, MX records, and other DNS entries  
- **Cloud Services**: Public cloud resources, storage buckets, and exposed APIs  
- **Third-Party Services**: External dependencies or integrations  

#### 2. Internal Attack Surface
Involves assets that may not be directly exposed but could be exploited once an attacker gains internal access:

- **Internal Web Applications**: Intranet portals, admin consoles  
- **Internal Networks**: Network segments, shared drives, internal APIs  

#### 3. Physical Attack Surface
Considers physical locations and devices:

- **Office Buildings**: Physical access points and security controls  
- **Employee Devices**: Laptops, mobile devices, USB drives  
- **IoT Devices**: Cameras, sensors, and smart devices  
- **Dumpster Diving Risks**: Documents or hardware in the trash

### Process of Attack Surface Mapping

1. **Discovery**: Identify all assets (external, internal, physical)  
2. **Enumeration**: Gather detailed information about each asset (e.g., versions, configurations)  
3. **Classification**: Determine the sensitivity and criticality of each asset  
4. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate potential vulnerabilities and the impact of an attack  
5. **Visualization**: Map out the attack surface using diagrams or tables  
6. **Prioritization**: Focus on the most critical and vulnerable points

### Tools and Techniques

- **Network Scanning**: Nmap, Masscan  
- **Web Crawling**: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite  
- **OSINT**: Recon-ng, Maltego, Shodan  
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Nessus, OpenVAS  
- **Cloud Tools**: ScoutSuite, CloudMapper  
- **Physical Recon**: Physical walkthroughs and social engineering assessments
