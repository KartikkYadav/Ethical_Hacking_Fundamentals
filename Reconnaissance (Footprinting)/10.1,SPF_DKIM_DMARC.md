# 📧 Email Authentication Records: DKIM, SPF, and DMARC

---



## 📬 SPF Record (Sender Policy Framework)

SPF is an email authentication method that helps prevent spammers from sending messages on behalf of your domain.

### 🔧 Purpose of SPF
- SPF is a DNS TXT record that specifies authorized mail servers.
- Helps prevent spoofing and spam.
> "If they know who sent them the letter, the recipient is more likely to open it."

### 🔧 How SPF Works
1. **Domain owner adds an SPF record** to DNS.
2. **Receiving mail server checks** if the sender’s IP is authorized.
3. If authorized, the email **passes SPF**; otherwise, it may be rejected.

### 🌐 SPF Record Location
- Only needed for the **top-level domain** (e.g., `your-domain.com`).
- Applies automatically to subdomains like `mail.your-domain.com`.

### ⚠️ SPF Limitations
- **Maximum 255 characters** per string.
- **Maximum 10 DNS lookups** allowed.

### ✅ Benefits of SPF
- Prevents unauthorized mail.
- Improves email deliverability.
- Works with DKIM and DMARC.

### 🧾 Example SPF Record



**Explanation:**
    
    v=spf1 ip4:192.168.0.1 include:_spf.google.com -all

- `v=spf1`: SPF version
- `ip4:192.168.0.1`: Authorized IP
- `include:_spf.google.com`: Includes Google’s mail servers
- `-all`: Reject all others

## 🔐 DKIM Record (DomainKeys Identified Mail)

DKIM is an email authentication method designed to detect forged sender addresses and message tampering. It adds a digital signature to email headers to verify the authenticity and integrity of the message.

### 🔒 Purpose of DKIM
- Ensures email content is not tampered with during transmission.
- Verifies that headers (like "From") have not been altered.
- Confirms that the sender owns or is authorized by the domain.

### 🔑 How DKIM Works

#### 1. Key Generation
- **Private Key**: Stored securely on the sender’s mail server.
- **Public Key**: Published in the domain's DNS as a TXT record.

#### 2. Signing the Email
- The private key signs specific parts of the email.
- A DKIM signature is added to the email header.

#### 3. Verifying the Signature
- The receiving server fetches the public key from DNS.
- It verifies the signature using the public key.

### 🌐 DNS TXT Record
- DKIM public key is stored in a TXT record.
- Common DNS providers: GoDaddy, Namecheap, Cloudflare, etc.

**Example TXT Record:**


### 🛡️ DKIM vs SPF

| Feature                  | DKIM | SPF |
|--------------------------|------|-----|
| Verifies sender domain   | ✅   | ✅  |
| Prevents message tampering | ✅ | ❌  |
| Uses encryption          | ✅   | ❌  |
| DNS based                | ✅   | ✅  |

### ✅ Benefits of DKIM
- Helps prevent spoofing.
- Improves email deliverability.
- Works alongside SPF and DMARC.

## 🛡️ DMARC Record (Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)

DMARC is a standard that protects email senders and recipients from spoofing, spam, and phishing. It builds on SPF and DKIM.

### 🎯 What DMARC Does
- Helps domain owners **control how mail is handled** if SPF or DKIM fails.
- Enables **reporting** of authentication results.
- Prevents attackers from spoofing your domain.

### 🔗 DMARC Builds on SPF and DKIM
- DMARC is not an authentication protocol itself.
- It **relies on SPF and DKIM** to function.
- For DMARC to pass:
  - **Both SPF and DKIM must pass**
  - At least **one must be aligned**

### 📌 Alignment Explained

#### ✅ SPF Alignment
- The **"From" domain** must match the **Return-Path domain**.

#### ✅ DKIM Alignment
- The **"From" domain** must match the **DKIM `d=` domain**.

### ✅ Summary of DMARC Requirements

| Protocol | Requirement for DMARC |
|----------|------------------------|
| **SPF**  | Must pass + From-domain = Return-Path |
| **DKIM** | Must pass + From-domain = DKIM `d=` domain |
| **DMARC**| One or both must pass and be aligned |
