# 📧 Email Spoofing

## 🚀 What is Email Spoofing?
Email spoofing is a technique used in cyber attacks to forge the **“From” address** of an email, making it appear as though it came from a trusted or legitimate source, even though it did not.

### 🎯 Goal
- To trick the recipient into opening, trusting, or acting on a fraudulent email, such as:
  - Clicking malicious links
  - Downloading attachments
  - Disclosing sensitive information

---

## ⚙️ How Email Spoofing Works
- Spoofing typically modifies the **SMTP “MAIL FROM”** or **“From” header** in an email.
- SMTP lacks built-in authentication, making it easy for attackers to forge the sender field.
- Attackers often use **open mail relays** or **misconfigured MTAs** to send spoofed messages.
- Advanced spoofing techniques include:
  - Faking `Reply-To`
  - Manipulating the display name
  - Altering entire email headers

## 📜 Example of Spoofed Email Header

    From: "Bank Support" support@bank.com
    Reply-To: hacker@gmail.com
    Received: from attacker-server.com (192.0.2.1)

  ➡️ The “From” address looks legitimate, but the email actually originated from `attacker-server.com`.

## ⚠️ Risks of Email Spoofing
- Phishing attacks
- Business Email Compromise (BEC)
- Credential theft
- Malware distribution

---

## 🔍 Detecting Email Spoofing
- **Check email headers** for suspicious `Received:` lines and IP addresses.
- **Verify SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records** to see if the sender’s domain implements proper authentication.

## 🛡️ Preventing Email Spoofing (Defensive Measures)

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **SPF (Sender Policy Framework)** | Defines which mail servers are allowed to send on behalf of a domain. |
| **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)** | Adds a digital signature to verify that the message content hasn’t been altered. |
| **DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance)** | Combines SPF & DKIM to enforce policy and report spoofing attempts. |

## 💻 Command-Line: Checking DMARC/SPF/DKIM Records
You can use the `dig` command to query DNS TXT records for SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.


## Check TXT records for armourinfosec.com
dig -t txt armourinfosec.com

## Check TXT records for india.gov.in
dig -t txt india.gov.in

✅ Look for

    v=DMARC1 → for DMARC

    v=spf1 → for SPF

    k=rsa; p=... → for DKIM (found in selector subdomain)
