## WHOIS Lookup

**WHOIS Lookup** is a process used to retrieve information about who owns a domain name (like example.com). Here's a brief explanation:

## What is WHOIS Lookup?

- WHOIS Lookup is a protocol (and a set of databases) that stores information about domain name registrations.
- When you perform a WHOIS Lookup, you can see details such as:
  - Domain owner (registrant) name (if not protected by privacy).
  - Contact email and phone number.
  - Domain creation and expiration dates.
  - Registrar (the company where the domain is registered).
  - Name servers (DNS servers used by the domain).
  - Status of the domain (e.g., `clientTransferProhibited`, `ok`, etc.).

## Why Use WHOIS Lookup?

- **Security Investigations**: Check if a suspicious domain is linked to known malicious activity.
- **Brand Protection**: See who registered domains similar to your brand.
- **Domain Purchase**: Contact domain owners if you want to buy a domain.
- **Technical Management**: Verify the domain's DNS records and status.
- **Legal Compliance**: Ensure your domain registration information is accurate and updated.
- **SEO Research**: Understand domain age, history, and ownership for SEO and backlink analysis.

## How to Perform a WHOIS Lookup?

You can use:

- **Web tools** (like those listed below).
- **Command-line tools** (like the `whois` command on Linux).

**Example using Linux:**

This will show the WHOIS record of `example.com` right in the terminal:


whois example.com

- Examples of WHOIS Lookup Commands

## Basic WHOIS Lookup:

    whois google.com

Check multiple domains at once (using a loop in Bash):

    for domain in example.com test.com domain.com; do whois $domain; done

Save WHOIS data to a file:

    whois example.com > example-whois.txt

Use a proxy WHOIS server (sometimes needed for certain TLDs):

    whois -h whois.nic.xyz example.xyz
