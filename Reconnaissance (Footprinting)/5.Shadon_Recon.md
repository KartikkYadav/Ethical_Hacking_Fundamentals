# 🌐 Notes on Shodan Recon

---

## 🔍 How Shodan Works
- Shodan is a **search engine for internet-connected devices**.
- Unlike Google, which indexes web pages, Shodan indexes:
  - IoT devices
  - Webcams
  - Routers, servers
  - Industrial systems (ICS/SCADA)
- It works by **scanning IP ranges across the internet**, grabbing banner information (service details), and storing it for search.

## 🔎 Basic Search Usage

  - Search by keyword:

-  apache , nginx

- Search by IP:
     net:192.168.1.0/24


- Search by port:

-

## 📝 Filter Reference
- Some common filters to refine Shodan queries:
- `port:80` – restrict to specific ports
- `country:"US"` – limit by country
- `org:"Amazon"` – by organization
- `os:"Windows"` – by operating system
- `product:"Apache"` – by software
- `ssl` – only results with SSL certificates
- `hostname:"example.com"`

Examples:
apache country:"IN" port:8080
ssh org:"Google"

## 🚨 Vulnerability Matching
- Shodan integrates **CVE vulnerability data** into search results.
- You can filter devices known to have vulnerabilities, e.g.:

      vuln:CVE-2022-1388

- Helps prioritize targets during assessments by identifying systems with known exploits.

## 🖥 User Interface + API

### User Interface (UI)
- Web dashboard at [https://www.shodan.io](https://www.shodan.io)
- Provides:
- Saved searches
- Graphical trends (top ports, countries)
- Maps of discovered devices
- Supports quick exploration and exporting results.

### API
- Shodan provides a **robust REST API** for automation:
- Search queries
- Host lookups
- Data downloads
- Useful in Python scripts, penetration testing tools, SIEM integrations.
- Example Python snippet:
```python
import shodan

     api = shodan.Shodan("YOUR_API_KEY")
    results = api.search("apache country:US")

    for result in results['matches']:
    print(result['ip_str'])
