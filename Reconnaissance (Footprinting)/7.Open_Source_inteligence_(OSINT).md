## 📖 What is OSINT?

**Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)** is the process of collecting and analyzing publicly available information to produce actionable intelligence. It involves gathering data from open sources like the internet, public records, media, and social platforms.

**OSINT is widely used in:**
- 🛡️ Cybersecurity  
- 🚓 Law enforcement  
- 🪖 Military intelligence  
- 💼 Business intelligence  
- 🕵️ Investigative journalism  
- 🔍 Threat hunting and cybercrime investigations

## 🔑 Key Components of OSINT  

### 📚 Sources of OSINT  
- **Internet:**  
  Websites, blogs, forums, company websites.  

- **Social Media:**  
  Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Telegram, etc.  

- **Public Records:**  
  Government databases, court filings, company registries.  

- **News & Media:**  
  News websites, TV, radio broadcasts.  

- **Academic Databases:**  
  Research papers, patents, scientific journals.  

- **Geospatial Data:**

## 🛠️ Common Techniques  

- **Web Scraping:**  
  Automating data collection from websites.  

- **Social Media Monitoring:**  
  Tracking posts, mentions, and user behavior.  

- **Google Dorking:**  
  Using advanced Google search operators to find sensitive or hidden information.  

- **Metadata Analysis:**  
  Extracting hidden information from files (e.g., EXIF data in images, PDF metadata).  

- **Geolocation:**  
  Pinpointing locations based on images, social media posts, or IP addresses.  

- **Passive Footprinting:**  
  Gathering information without interacting with the target.  

- **Active Footprinting:**  
  Directly interacting with the target (e.g., DNS queries, port scanning).
